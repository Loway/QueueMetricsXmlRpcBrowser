QueueMetricsXmlRpcBrowser
=========================

An XML-RPC services browser for QueueMetrics written in PHP.

Meant to be easy to set-up - just clone it in a directory to be put on a server supporting PHP.
You need to have QueueMetrics reachable over its HTTP port from the server, of course.

Very initial release - at the moment only QM.stats() and QM.realtime() are implemented.
